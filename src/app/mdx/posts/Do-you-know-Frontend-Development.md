## Motivation
- I am keep hearing this kind of statement
- I won't blame that because I would agree frontend would be a kind of swe job that is easier to enter (if not, there won't be so many bootcamp out there)
- but do not underestimate how deep and interesting can frontend go
- I am writing down this to avoid keep explaining how interesting frontend dev is to my friends

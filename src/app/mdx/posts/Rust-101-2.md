## Preface

üìî I used the **[comprehensive-rust](https://github.com/google/comprehensive-rust)** by Google as learning resource. It is used for internal educating at first but recently released to general public. If you want to learn Rust, check out this great resource! 

‚ùóThis is the 2nd learning note of this series. If you want to learn from start and it's your first time here, make sure to check out the [1st post](https://swh00tw.dev/Rust-101-1). 

Alright, let's get started.
## Control Flow
### Blocks
Definition: A block in Rust contains a bunch of expressions. They are wrapped by `{}`. The block actually has a value and type, which are defined by the last expression of the block.

Note that, **sometimes**, you cannot write `return` in the block. See the wrong example $1.2$ below, it will throw compile error. I guess the compiler will seem the `return` inside the block as the `return` for the `main` function. And the error message will tell you the expression under the first `return` is unreachable.

But if there are no such conflict, you can feel free to use both. (example $2.1$ & $2.2$)

```rust
// ‚úÖ example 1.1 
fn main() {
	// there's a block here and the type would be "int"
	let x = {
		let y = 10
		y = y + 2;
		y // the last expression of the block is the value of the block
	}
	return x;
}
// ‚ùå example 1.2
fn main() {
	// there's a block here and the type would be "int"
	let x = {
		let y = 10
		y = y + 2;
		return y;
	}
	return x;
}
// ‚úÖ example 2.1
fn double(x: int32) -> int32 {
	x + x
}
// ‚úÖ example 2.2
fn double(x: int32) -> int32 {
	return x + x;
}

```

### `If` expressions
It basically works like other language. 
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 10;
    if x % 2 == 0 {
        x = x / 2;
    } else {
        x = 3 * x + 1;
    }
}
```
But there is a cool expression like this
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 10;
    x = if x % 2 == 0 {
        x / 2
    } else {
        3 * x + 1
    };
}
```
I think it's like ternary operator in Javascript and similar thing in Python
```js
// Javascript
let x = 10;
const x = x % 2 == 0 ? x / 2 : 3 * x + 1 
```

```python
# Python
x = 10
x = x / 2 if x % 2 == 0 else 3 * x + 1
```

‚ùóNote that, in Rust, two branch blocks of the `if` expression must have the same type.

### For loop & While loop
They are both similar to Python. 
- Python's `range(start, end)` can be written in Rust like this `(start..end)`
- We can specify step size like this `(start..end).step_by(step_size)`
- The usage of `break` and `continue` are the same as other languages. But there is a cool thing like this. You can label `break` and `continue`, and `while` loop to choose which loop you want to `break` or `continue` when there are nested `while` loops.
	```rust
	fn main() {
	    let v = vec![10, 20, 30];
	    let mut iter = v.into_iter();
	    'outer: while let Some(x) = iter.next() {
	        println!("x: {x}");
	        let mut i = 0;
	        while i < x {
	            println!("x: {x}, i: {i}");
	            i += 1;
	            if i == 3 {
	                break 'outer;
	            }
	        }
	    }
	}	
	```
	In this case, we break the outer loop after 3 iterations of the inner loop.
	The output world be 
	```
	x: 10
	x: 10, i: 0
	x: 10, i: 1
	x: 10, i: 2
	```

### `loop` expression

It's an infinite loop. You can think it as `while true`. The only way to stop is use `break` or `return`.

## Variables

### `const`
`const` defines a value which cannot be changed after declaration. To comply convention, we use `ALL_UPPER_CASE_AND_UNDERSCORE` to name the variable.
```rust
const DIGEST_SIZE: usize = 3;
const ZERO: Option<u8> = Some(42);

fn compute_digest(text: &str) -> [u8; DIGEST_SIZE] {
	let mut digest = [ZERO.unwrap_or(0); DIGEST_SIZE];
	for (idx, &b) in text.as_bytes().iter().enumerate() {
		digest[idx % DIGEST_SIZE] = digest[idx % DIGEST_SIZE].wrapping_add(b);
	}
	digest
}

fn main() {
	let digest = compute_digest("Hello");
	println!("digest: {digest:?}");
}
```

In above code snippet:
- Type `Option<T>` is a Rust enum that represents an optional value: either a value of type `T`(need to wrap the value in `Some`) exists or does not exist(`None`). It's similar to `T?` in Typescript.
	```rust
	fn divide(numerator: f64, denominator: f64) -> Option<f64> {
	    if denominator == 0.0 {
	        None
	    } else {
	        Some(numerator / denominator)
	    }
	}
	```
- `unwrap_or(value)` is a method to unwrap `Option<T>`(produced by `Some()`), if the value is not `None`, `unwrap_or` will return its value, else if it's `None`, it will return `value`.
- `string.as_bytes()` converts string into a byte slice. And then `iter()` creates an iterator allows us to loop over it. `enumerate()` is identical to Python's `enumerate`, which let you to access index of the slice.
- `wrapping_add` is to prevent overflow at runtime, which can cause panic. After adding this, it will provide function like modulo operation. So, let's say we have an `u8` equal to its max value 255. After adding 1 by `wrappin_add(1)`, it will become 0 rather than overflow.
`
### `static`

Static variables will live during the whole execution of the program, and therefore will not move. It's similar to `const` but different in some ways.
- `const` is compile time constant; `static` is runtime constant.
- It means `const` will be copy to each line that use that `const` at compile time. Therefore, `const` don't have a fixed memory location.
- `static` is still there at runtime. It has fixed memory location.

### Shadowing

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = 10;
    println!("before: {a}");

    {
        let a = "hello";
        println!("inner scope: {a}");

        let a = true;
        println!("shadowed in inner scope: {a}");
    }

    println!("after: {a}");
}

/* 
before: 10  
inner scope: hello  
shadowed in inner scope: true  
after: 10
*/
```
It's different from mutation because when shadowing, both variable's (with same name) memory locations exist at the same time.

### Enums

An enum itself is a type(like `WebEvent` below). An enum can have several Variants. Variant can have payload (like `KeyPress` and `Click` below). Note that we need to write namespace to access the Variant, like `WebEvent::PageLoad`.
```rust
enum WebEvent {
    PageLoad,                 // Variant without payload
    KeyPress(char),           // Tuple struct variant
    Click { x: i64, y: i64 }, // Full struct variant
}
```
We can use `match` (like `switch` and `case` in other languages) to do pattern matching. Note that there is no fall-through like other languages, so we don't need to add `break` for each case.
```rust
fn inspect(event: WebEvent) {
    match event {
        WebEvent::PageLoad       => println!("page loaded"),
        WebEvent::KeyPress(c)    => println!("pressed '{c}'"),
        WebEvent::Click { x, y } => println!("clicked at x={x}, y={y}"),
    }
}

```

## Novel Control Flow

### `if let`

It let you execute different blocks depending on whether a value matches a pattern.
```rust
fn main() {
    let arg = std::env::args().next();
    if let Some(value) = arg {
        println!("Program name: {value}");
    } else {
        println!("Missing name?");
    }
}
```
In the above code, `Some(value)` can either be `value` or `None` depending on the `arg`.

### `while let`
Similar to `if let`, if the `while let` failed, the loop will be break. In the example, `iter` has type `Option<i32>`.
```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![10, 20, 30];
    let mut iter = v.into_iter();

    while let Some(x) = iter.next() {
        println!("x: {x}");
    }
}

// Actually, while let is a syntax sugar, we can produce this kind of effect by using if let
fn main() {
	let v = vec![10, 20, 30];
    let mut iter = v.into_iter();

	loop {
		if let Some(x) = iter.next() {
			// do something
		}
		else {
			break;
		}
	}
}
```

## Pattern Matching

### Destructing Structs
Pattern matching `match` expression can not only destruct Enums(e.g. the `WebEvent` example above), it can also destruct `structs`.

```rust
struct Foo {
    x: (u32, u32),
    y: u32,
}

#[rustfmt::skip]
fn main() {
    let foo = Foo { x: (1, 2), y: 2 };
    match foo {
        Foo { x: (1, b), y } => println!("x.0 = 1, b = {b}, y = {y}"),
        Foo { y: 2, x: i }   => println!("y = 2, x = {i:?}"),
        Foo { y, .. }        => println!("y = {y}, other fields were ignored"),
    }
}

// x.0 = 1, b = 2, y = 2
```
In this example, the first condition matches `struct` `Foo` when `x.0 == 1`. The second one catches when `y==2`. And the last expression is the wildcard, and it only need to use `y`'s value.
Note that, in this example, even `y==2`, since the first line matches first. It will print `x.0 = 1, b = 2, y = 2` instead of `y = 2, x = (1, 2)`. So, **order matters**.

### Destructing Arrays

Of course, you can also destruct arrays or tuple. The code looks very similar as above example and self-explainable.
```rust
#[rustfmt::skip]
fn main() {
    let triple = [0, -2, 3];
    println!("Tell me about {triple:?}");
    match triple {
        [0, y, z] => println!("First is 0, y = {y}, and z = {z}"),
        [1, ..]   => println!("First is 1 and the rest were ignored"),
        _         => println!("All elements were ignored"),
    }
}
```

### Match Guards

When pattern matching, you can also write some expression to achieve some custom logics. This is called Match Guards. It's a flexible way to do pattern matching. The arm will be triggered only when the boolean expression return true.
```rust
#[rustfmt::skip]
fn main() {
    let pair = (2, 2);
    println!("Tell me about {pair:?}");
    match pair {
        (x, y) if x == y     => println!("These are twins {x}"),
        (x, y) if x + y == 0 => println!("Antimatter, kaboom!"),
        (x, _) if x % 2 == 1 => println!("The first one is odd"),
        _                    => println!("No correlation..."),
    }
}
```

## Exercise

### Luhn algorithm

[Problem setting](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/exercises/day-1/luhn.html):

The¬†[Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)¬†is used to validate credit card numbers. The algorithm takes a string as input and does the following to validate the credit card number:

- Ignore all spaces. Reject number with less than two digits.
    
- Moving from¬†**right to left**, double every second digit: for the number¬†`1234`, we double¬†`3`¬†and¬†`1`. For the number¬†`98765`, we double¬†`6`¬†and¬†`8`.
    
- After doubling a digit, sum the digits if the result is greater than 9. So doubling¬†`7`¬†becomes¬†`14`¬†which becomes¬†`1 + 4 = 5`.
    
- Sum all the undoubled and doubled digits.
    
- The credit card number is valid if the sum ends with¬†`0`.

My solution:
- First, I loop through the string and see if there's any non-digit character. If found, return False directly. Note that `|c| c.is_alphabetic()` is how Rust write Lambda function like Python.
- Then, I filter out the spaces in the string and convert the digit character to `u8` and collect by `Vec`.
- Next, I just perform the "Doubling" step as problem setting mentions above.
- Sum and return `bool`.
```rust
fn doubling(x: u32) -> u32 {
    let mut tmp = x;
    tmp *= 2;
    if tmp > 9 {
        tmp = 1 + (tmp % 10);
    }
    tmp
}

pub fn luhn(cc_number: &str) -> bool {
    // Check for English letters
    if cc_number.chars().any(|c| c.is_alphabetic()) {
        return false;
    }
    // filter and convert str to vec<u8>
    let mut vec: Vec<u32> = cc_number.chars().filter(
        |c| c.is_digit(10)
    ).filter_map(
        |c| c.to_digit(10)
    ).collect();
    // reject if less than 2 digits or empty
    if vec.len() < 2 {
        return false
    }
    // traverse and apply doubling operation
    let is_odd: bool = vec.len() % 2 == 1;
    for i in 0..vec.len() {
        let digit = vec[i];
        if is_odd {
            if i % 2 == 1 {
                vec[i] = doubling(digit);
            }
        } else {
            if i % 2 == 0 {
                vec[i] = doubling(digit);
            }
        }
    }
    // sum all up
    let summation = vec.iter().fold(0u32, |sum, i| sum + (*i as u32));
    return summation % 10 == 0;
}
```

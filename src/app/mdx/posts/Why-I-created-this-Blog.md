## Why I start writing? Again?

Great. Let's get straight to the point. I want to talk about the motivation of why I creating this blog.

Why do I say "again?". Actually, this is not the first time I want to start writing. I once wanted to write something on Medium regularly before, but I did not persist. I think my contents are not valuable. I doubt anyone want to see my articles. I suck at writing. It's waste of time for doing this.

However, after reading Ryan Peterman's article - [Why engineers need to write](https://www.developing.dev/p/why-engineers-need-to-write) - and knowing lots of strong engineers write blog. I started to be convinced. I started to think: Okay, maybe this time, I should persist longer. It takes time to see the benefit. I need to be patient and it's normal to be bad at writing at first. No one can do it perfectly at first.

Well, that's why I create this blog. Nothing dramatically. The reason is pretty straightforward. I just love to learn new things and want to master the art of writing now. So, let's see how far can I go this time.

## Benefits

Here I listed some benefits of writing or how writing can help me to be a better engineer. That's how I convince myself to invest time on this.

### Think deeper than before

Writing something lots of people already know, that's waste of time. Writing something fewer people know, that's producing value.

Then, how can you generate a decent article? You must spend lots of time doing research on some topics and reading documents, right? That's what I am talking about. Writing can motivate you to dig deeper into a topic.

### Practice output

In an interview, the interviewer likely will ask you to explain something that they didn't know before; In your job, you probably will need to explain your idea to your colleague; At some points in your career, you probably will need to write some docs. Those situations, you will not want to fuck up and generate something hard to understand.

Well, then writing can help. Writing is the process of processing profound idea and turning that into simple words you and others can understand easily. If you can write well, you probably will ace any interview and be a good coworker.

### We have limited memory space

I still think I am bad at writing. There is a voice in my head saying: No one read your piece of shi...

However, the truth is, even no one can get something beneficial and insightful from you, you can still benefit yourself.

I am a person who love to learn new things. However, due to limited memory space, just like computer, I can't remember everything. The more new things I learn, the more things I forgot. At the end of the day, we can't escape from forgetting things. BUT, we can write it down to help ourselves in the future. After learning and turning the knowledge into your words, the knowledge will become easy to recall and pick up in the future.

Well, that's it. You see, even if no one read your stuff, there are still lots of benefit you can get from start writing. Hope I won't quit this time and this article can inspire someone like me!

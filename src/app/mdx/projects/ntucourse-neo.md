[National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) offers many valuable courses, but the process of planning them can be stressful. We alleviate the challenging course selection experience by organizing scattered information and providing students with an intuitive user interface.

Our service ended since our team decided to collaborate with NTU for working on the next-gen official course information system. The service has been migrated to [course.ntu.edu.tw](https://course.ntu.edu.tw/). By the time Neo retired, Neo had accumulated over 5,000 user visits and had more than 1,500 registered users.

We created a [demo website](https://ncn.pages.dev/) for demo purpose and also document the story of Neo.
